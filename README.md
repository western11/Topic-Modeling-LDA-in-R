# Topic-Modeling-LDA-in-R
Topic modeling using tidytext and textmineR package with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm.

There are many techniques that are used to obtain topic models, namely: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Correlated Topic Models (CTM) and TextRank. In this study we will focus to implement LDA algorithm to build topic model with `tidytext` and `textmineR` package. Not only building model, we will also evaluate the goodness of fit of the model using some metrics like R-squared or log-likelihood. There's also some metrics like `coherence` and `prevalence` to measure the quality of topics.
